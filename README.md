# td-vdom

basically react :innocent:

minimal js library with jsx support for building functional and stateful components (hooks to come), inspiration and motivation based solely on learning virtual dom and how libraries like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) actually work.

## As it stands

_proper import & usage to come, for now_

Import to your project & add following to your react code to use this library: 
```
/** @jsx vdom.createElement */
```

This library supports both [functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) & [class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#converting-a-function-to-a-class). Full support for props & lifecycle methods. 

Hooks coming..
